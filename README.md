Alternatively, you can build the program yourself (but why would you need to?!)

### What this program does
It simply deletes 4 files in the AppData folder. Nothing much to it at all in reality. I made this program because other programs I found online either didn't work for me or it was just the code itself, not any user friendly downloadable program.
